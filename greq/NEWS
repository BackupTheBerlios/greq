0.9.1
     !!!!!ATTENTION!!!!
     Because bash collapses all occurrences of IFS whitespace, the output
     format of greq has changed in this version to use '\a' as its IFS.
     This means that all scripts that rely on prior versions will have to
     be changed. Fortunately, as this is only the second public release,
     I hope that the breakage will not be too bad ;-)
